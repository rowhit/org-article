* Org-article
  - Tangle an article class for Org-mode LaTeX export
  - It is forked from https://github.com/tsdye/org-article.git
  
* Update info
  - adding support for Chinese characters using the famous ctex package
  
  Now, by adding the two lines at the beginning of you Org file, everything follows up:
  #+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,ctex,a5paper,DIV=15,landscape,10pt,listings-sv,microtype,paralist]
 
  Notice, the key is the ctex, the other options are backward compatible.
  
  Enjoy Emacs, Enjoy Latex.
